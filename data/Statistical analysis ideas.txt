Customer Retention Metrics

Key Questions:
How many patients return for follow-up consultations or procedures?

What percentage of patients are "repeat customers" vs. "one-time visitors"?

Statistics to Calculate:

Retention Rate:
(Number of patients with ≥2 consultations / Total unique patients) * 100

Cohort Analysis:

Group patients by their first consultation date (monthly/quarterly cohorts).

Track how many return within 30/60/90 days for follow-ups (e.g., exams, referrals).

Churn Rate:
(Patients who never returned after their first consultation / Total patients) * 100

Insights:
Identify "high-value" patients (frequent returners) and target them for loyalty programs.

Flag patients who received test requests/referrals but never scheduled follow-ups.

2. Procedure and Category Analysis
Key Questions:
Which procedures (TUSS codes) or prescription/test/referral categories are most common?

Do specific procedures correlate with higher retention?

Statistics to Calculate:
Top Procedures:

sql
Copy
SELECT TUSS_code, COUNT(*) AS frequency 
FROM structured_data 
GROUP BY TUSS_code 
ORDER BY frequency DESC
Category Distribution:

sql
Copy
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS frequency 
FROM unstructured_data 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY frequency DESC
Cross-Analysis:

Do patients with unstructured prescriptions/test requests return less often than those with TUSS-coded procedures?

Insights:
Prioritize resources for high-frequency procedures (e.g., staffing for common exams).

Identify underutilized services (e.g., referrals not leading to follow-ups).

3. Time-Based Analysis
Key Questions:
Is there seasonality in consultations (e.g., flu season spikes)?

How quickly do patients schedule follow-up exams after a referral?

Statistics to Calculate:
Time Between Consultations:

sql
Copy
SELECT patient_id, 
  DATE_DIFF(next_consult_date, consult_date, DAY) AS days_between_visits
FROM structured_data
Time-to-Action:

For patients with test requests, measure the average time between referral and exam scheduling.

Insights:
Optimize scheduling during peak periods (e.g., add staff for seasonal demand).

Send reminders to patients who delay follow-ups beyond a threshold (e.g., >14 days).

4. Hospital Loyalty Metrics
Key Questions:
Do patients schedule follow-up exams at the same hospital?

Which procedures are most likely to "leak" to external providers?

Statistics to Calculate:
Same-Hospital Retention:

sql
Copy
(Patients who scheduled follow-up exams at the same hospital / Total patients with referrals) * 100
Procedure Leakage:

Identify TUSS codes or categories (e.g., MRI, specialist referrals) where patients often go elsewhere.

Insights:
Promote in-house services for high-leakage procedures (e.g., discounts, faster scheduling).

Highlight convenience factors (e.g., "Book your next exam here in 1 click!").

5. Predictive Analytics
Key Questions:
Which patients are at risk of not returning?

Can we predict exam scheduling based on historical behavior?

Models to Build:
Churn Prediction:

Use features like days_since_last_visit, procedure_type, and category to predict likelihood of returning.

Exam Scheduling Likelihood:

Predict if a patient will schedule a follow-up exam after a referral.

Insights:
Proactively engage at-risk patients with personalized offers (e.g., SMS reminders).

Allocate marketing budgets to high-priority patients.

6. Operational Efficiency
Key Questions:
Are there bottlenecks in exam scheduling or resource allocation?

Which procedures have the longest wait times?

Statistics to Calculate:
Procedure Duration:

sql
Copy
SELECT TUSS_code, AVG(exam_duration) 
FROM structured_data 
GROUP BY TUSS_code
Peak Hours:

sql
Copy
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM consult_time) AS hour, COUNT(*) AS consultations 
FROM structured_data 
GROUP BY hour
Insights:
Optimize staff schedules to match demand peaks (e.g., mornings for lab tests).

Streamline workflows for high-duration procedures.

7. Revenue Impact
Key Questions:
Do repeat customers generate more revenue than one-time patients?

Which procedures/categories are most profitable?

Statistics to Calculate:
Lifetime Value (LTV):

sql
Copy
SELECT patient_id, SUM(procedure_cost) AS total_spent 
FROM structured_data 
GROUP BY patient_id
Cost of Acquisition vs. Retention:

Compare marketing costs for new vs. returning patients.

Insights:
Focus on retaining high-LTV patients (e.g., VIP perks).

Adjust pricing for low-margin, high-frequency procedures.

8. Data Quality Checks
Missing TUSS Codes:

sql
Copy
SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_tuss 
FROM structured_data 
WHERE TUSS_code IS NULL
Unclassified Text:

sql
Copy
SELECT COUNT(*) AS unclassified 
FROM unstructured_data 
WHERE category NOT IN ('prescription', 'test_request', 'referral')
Visualization Recommendations
Retention Dashboard:

Cohort analysis heatmaps.

Retention curves (e.g., % returning after 30/60/90 days).

Procedure Analysis:

Top TUSS codes (bar charts).

Procedure leakage (sunburst charts).

Operational Metrics:

Peak hours (line charts).

Exam scheduling timelines (Gantt charts).

By combining structured TUSS codes with your ML-classified unstructured data, you’ll uncover actionable insights to improve retention, operational efficiency, and revenue. Use BigQuery to join datasets (e.g., patient_id and date), and leverage Looker Studio for interactive dashboards.
